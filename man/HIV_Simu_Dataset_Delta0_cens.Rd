\title{HIV RNA Load Simulated Data for Delta AUC = 0 With Left-censored data}
\format{
A data frame with 4 columns and 1000 rows:
\tabular{ll}{
\code{id} \tab The subject id. \cr
\code{time} \tab Time of HIV RNA load measurements. \cr
\code{Group} \tab Treatment group. \cr
\code{VL} \tab The HIV RNA load measures. Measures are either equals to their true value (if VL > LOD) or to the LOD value (otherwise). \cr
\code{Cens} \tab The indicator of left-censoring: 1 if VLtrue <= LOD and 0 otherwise. \cr
}

\description{
This dataset gives simulated longitudinal log-transformed HIV RNA load dynamics for two distinct groups of patients who interrupted their antiretroviral treatment at baseline (time=0).
The group 'Group1' was simulated to mimic a control group while the group 'Group2' gathers patients assigned to a treatment group.
Each group accounts for 20 patients and each of them were followed for 24 weeks with one measure every week. HIV RNA load values are left-censored due to a limit of detection (LOD), considering log10(50) as threshold value.
This dataset was simulated to obtain a similar area under the mean HIV RNA load curves, despite the difference of the mean dynamics shape (without considering the left-censorship).
