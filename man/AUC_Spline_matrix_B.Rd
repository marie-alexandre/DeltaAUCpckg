\title{Spline interpolation Method - Matrix of the zero orer derivative coefficients}
\usage{
AUC_Spline_matrix_B(time)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{a numerical vector of time points (x-axis cooordinates).}
}
\value{
a tridiagonal matrix corresponding to the weights of the variable of interest in the spline interpolation method. In this version, the matrix is build considering the "not-a-knot" spline boundary conditions.
}
\description{
In the area under the curve calculation using the spline interpolation method, the vector of the second derivative of the outcome of interest \emph{Y} is expressed as \eqn{A Y^{''} = B Y  + F}. This function calculate calculate the matrix B.
