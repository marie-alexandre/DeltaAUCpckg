\title{HIV RNA Load Simulated Data for Delta AUC = 0}
\format{
A data frame with 4 columns and 1000 rows:
\tabular{ll}{
\code{id} \tab The subject id. \cr
\code{time} \tab Time of HIV RNA load measurements. \cr
\code{Group} \tab Treatment group. \cr
\code{VL} \tab The HIV RNA load measures. \cr
}
}
\usage{
HIV_Simu_Dataset_Delta0
}
\description{
This dataset gives simulated longitudinal log-transformed HIV RNA load dynamics for two distinct groups of patients who interrupted their antiretroviral treatment at baseline (time=0).
The group 'Group1' was simulated to mimic a control group while the group 'Group2' gathers patients assigned to a treatment group.
Each group accounts for 20 patients and each of them were followed for 24 weeks with one measure every week.
This dataset was simulated to obtain a similar area under the mean HIV RNA load curves, despite the difference of the mean dynamics shape.
