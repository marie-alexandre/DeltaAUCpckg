Description: The goal of DeltaAUCpckg is to propose a statistical test evaluating the difference of Area under the curve (AUC) of a given outcome between two distinct groups of individuals. To this end, longitudinal data obtained for subjects splitted into G distincts groups are fitted with a Mixed-Effects model whose fixed-effects (marginal dynamics) and random-effects (individual dynamics) are respectively modeled by group-structured polynomial or B-splines curves and individual polynomial or B-spline curves.
